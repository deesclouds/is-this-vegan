**What does it do?**
This app checks if a food product is vegan.

It does this by finding the product that matches the UPC code entered.

It then cycles through the ingredients and returns a value of yes, no, idk and maybe.

yes = Green for the ingredient is vegan

idk & maybe = Yellow there is an uncertainty if the ingredient in the product is vegan

no = RED Definitely sure that the product is not vegan

"is-this-vegan" receives information from Api calls to [Open Food Facts](https://us.openfoodfacts.org/) then displays product ingredients to the user whether the product is vegan or not.
